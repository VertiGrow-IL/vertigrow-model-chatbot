## **Architecture and Workflow**  
This model utilizes **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**, fine-tuned with a specific dataset for **question-answering tasks**.

### **Processing Stages**:  
1. **Input**: A question in text form (e.g., *"What is T5?"*).  
2. **Tokenization**: Converts the input text into tokens using the T5 tokenizer.  
3. **Processing**:  
   - The model understands the input tokens using T5â€™s encoder-decoder architecture.  
4. **Output**: The model generates output tokens that are decoded back into text answers (e.g., *"T5 is a transformer-based model for NLP tasks."*).

## **Model Advantages**  
1. **Text-to-Text Approach**: All tasks are handled in a text-based input-output format, making the model highly flexible.  
2. **Relevant and Contextual Responses**: The model can understand language variations and provide suitable answers.  
3. **Training Efficiency**: Fine-tuned from a pre-trained T5 version, enabling high-quality results with limited data.  
4. **Customizable**: The model can be adapted for various domains or specific use cases.
